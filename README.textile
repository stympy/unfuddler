h1. The Unfuddler

A simple "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ app you can use to allow anyone to create tickets in your "Unfuddle":http://www.unfuddle.com/ account.

h2. Installation

You'll need Ruby, rubygems, and the sinatra gem.  Then you can simply run the unfuddler.rb file.  You can also use "Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#_sinatra with Apache or nginx to run the app.

h2. Credits

This simple bit of code was brought to you by "Benjamin Curtis":http://www.bencurtis.com, with a healthy sampling of code from "Unfuddle's site":http://unfuddle.com/support/tools.
